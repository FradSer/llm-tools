This repository contains a collection of tools developed during my exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs). The tools are implemented using both JavaScript (Bun/Node.js) and Python, focusing on various aspects of LLM development and data processing.

## Tools

### 1. tmx2jsonl

A tool for converting TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) files to JSONL format, making it easier to use translation data with LLMs.

- **Technology**: Bun + TypeScript
- **Status**: Available
- [Learn more about tmx2jsonl](./tmx2jsonl/README.md)
